 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now I beg you, brothers,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">The word for &#8220;brothers&#8221; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; or &#8220;siblings.&#8221;</span></a> through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe&#8217;s household, that there are contentions among you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now I mean this, that each one of you says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; &#8220;I follow Cephas,&#8221; and, &#8220;I follow Christ.&#8221;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don&#8217;t know whether I baptized any other.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News&#8212;not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn&#8217;t be made void.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For it is written, </div><div class="q">&#8220;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, </div><div class="q2">I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Isaiah 29:14</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn&#8217;t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn&#8217;t know God, it was God&#8217;s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that no flesh should boast before God.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>that, according as it is written, &#8220;He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&#8221;<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Jeremiah 9:24</span></a> </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 2</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When I came to you, brothers, I didn&#8217;t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>that your faith wouldn&#8217;t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But we speak God&#8217;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>which none of the rulers of this world has known.

Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God&#8217;s Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Which things also we speak, not in words which man&#8217;s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the natural man doesn&#8217;t receive the things of God&#8217;s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can&#8217;t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>&#8220;For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?&#8221; <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Isaiah 40:13</span></a> But we have Christ&#8217;s mind. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Brothers, I couldn&#8217;t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren&#8217;t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren&#8217;t you fleshly, and don&#8217;t you walk in the ways of men?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For when one says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; and another, &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; aren&#8217;t you fleshly?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers. You are God&#8217;s farming, God&#8217;s building.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>each man&#8217;s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man&#8217;s work is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If any man&#8217;s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If any man&#8217;s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Don&#8217;t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God&#8217;s Spirit lives in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If anyone destroys God&#8217;s temple, God will destroy him; for God&#8217;s temple is holy, which you are. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, &#8220;He has taken the wise in their craftiness.&#8221;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Job 5:13</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And again, &#8220;The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 94:11</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and you are Christ&#8217;s, and Christ is God&#8217;s. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 4</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So let a man think of us as Christ&#8217;s servants, and stewards of God&#8217;s mysteries.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man&#8217;s judgment. Yes, I don&#8217;t judge my own self.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn&#8217;t receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We are fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I don&#8217;t write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, you don&#8217;t have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For God&#8217;s Kingdom is not in word, but in power.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness? </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 5</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father&#8217;s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>You are puffed up, and didn&#8217;t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Your boasting is not good. Don&#8217;t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don&#8217;t even eat with such a person.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don&#8217;t you judge those who are within?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But those who are outside, God judges. &#8220;Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.&#8221;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7</span></a> </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 6</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Don&#8217;t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Don&#8217;t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I say this to move you to shame. Isn&#8217;t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Or don&#8217;t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God&#8217;s Kingdom? Don&#8217;t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists, will inherit God&#8217;s Kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Such were some of you, but you were washed.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">NU and TR have &#8220;what is owed her&#8221; instead of &#8220;the affection owed her&#8221;.</span></a> and likewise also the wife her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The wife doesn&#8217;t have authority over her own body, but the husband.

The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk.

Don&#8217;t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don&#8217;t seek a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and those who weep, as though they didn&#8217;t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn&#8217;t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn&#8217;t possess;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world&#8212;how she may please her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn&#8217;t sin. Let them marry.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no urgency, but has power over his own will, and has determined in his own heart to keep his own virgin, does well.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn&#8217;t give her in marriage does better. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God&#8217;s Spirit. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 8</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge.

But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don&#8217;t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol&#8217;s temple, won&#8217;t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don&#8217;t cause my brother to stumble. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 9</div><div class="p">&#13;
