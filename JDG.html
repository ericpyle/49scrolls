 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Yahweh&#8217;s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim.

You shall break down their altars.&#8217; But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore I also said, &#8216;I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.&#8217;&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When Yahweh&#8217;s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They called the name of that place Bochim,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">&#8220;Bochim&#8221; means &#8220;weepers&#8221;.</span></a> and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them, who didn&#8217;t know Yahweh, nor the work which he had done for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh&#8217;s sight, and served the Baals.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Yahweh&#8217;s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wherever they went out, Yahweh&#8217;s hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yet they didn&#8217;t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying Yahweh&#8217;s commandments. They didn&#8217;t do so.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They didn&#8217;t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh&#8217;s anger burned against Israel; and he said, &#8220;Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep Yahweh&#8217;s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.&#8221;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh&#8217;s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh&#8217;s sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh&#8217;s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh&#8217;s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh&#8217;s sight, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in Yahweh&#8217;s sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man&#8217;s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span></a> in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When he had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, &#8220;I have a secret message for you, O king.&#8221; </div><div class="p">The king said, &#8220;Keep silence!&#8221; All who stood by him left him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh&#8217;s sight, when Ehud was dead.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>She lived under Deborah&#8217;s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, &#8216;Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin&#8217;s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.&#8217;&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Barak said to her, &#8220;If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>She said, &#8220;I will surely go with you.
