 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>for the truth&#8217;s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don&#8217;t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Watch yourselves, that we don&#8217;t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whoever transgresses and doesn&#8217;t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn&#8217;t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If anyone comes to you, and doesn&#8217;t bring this teaching, don&#8217;t receive him into your house, and don&#8217;t welcome him,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Having many things to write to you, I don&#8217;t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen. </div><a id="bottom"/></div><ul class="tnav"><li><a href="index.html#Man">Man</a></li><li><a href="3JN.html#">3 John</a></li></ul></body></html>
