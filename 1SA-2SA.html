      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span></a> of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>As he did so year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s house. Her rival provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>She vowed a vow, and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a> of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>She said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for “heard by God.”</span></a> saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>But Hannah didn’t go up; for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh establish his word.” </div>
      <div class="p">So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a> of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child was young.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>I prayed for this child; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Therefore I have also given him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is given to Yahweh.” He worshiped Yahweh there. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 2</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Hannah prayed, and said: </div>
      <div class="q">“My heart exults in Yahweh! </div>
      <div class="q2">My horn is exalted in Yahweh. </div>

      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>There is no one as holy as Yahweh, </div>

      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>“Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly. </div>
      <div class="q2">Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth, </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires”; then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>He said to them, “Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Why do you<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">plural</span></a> kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’ </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Behold,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father’s house, that there will not be an old man in your house.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>The man of yours, whom I don’t cut off from my altar, will consume your eyes<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, blind your eyes with tears</span></a> and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>“ ‘This will be the sign to you, that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>I will raise me up a faithful priest, that will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed forever.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>It will happen, that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ” </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. Yahweh’s word was precious in those days. There were not many visions, then.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple, where God’s ark was;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.” </div>
      <div class="p">He went and lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Yahweh called yet again, “Samuel!” </div>
      <div class="p">Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </div>
      <div class="p">He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” </div>
      <div class="p">Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” </div>
      <div class="p">Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, “Samuel, my son!” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “Here I am.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 4</div>
      <div class="nb">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>The word of Samuel came to all Israel. </div>
      <div class="p">Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>When the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>A man of Benjamin ran out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?” </div>
      <div class="p">The man hurried, and came and told Eli.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “How did the matter go, my son?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark has been captured.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the news that God’s ark was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid; for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>She named the child Ichabod,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Ichabod” means “no glory”.</span></a> saying, “The glory has departed from Israel”; because God’s ark was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark has been taken.” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 5</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now the Philistines had taken God’s ark, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The Philistines took God’s ark, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>When the people of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>When they arose early on the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” </div>
      <div class="p">They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>It was so, that after they had carried it there, Yahweh’s hand was against the city with a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great so that tumors broke out on them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>So they sent God’s ark to Ekron. </div>
      <div class="p">As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go look for the donkeys.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren’t there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn’t find them. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>The servant said to him, “Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says surely happens. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Then Saul said to his servant, “But, behold, if we go, what should we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>The servant answered Saul again, and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 1/4 shekel would be a small coin of about 2.5 grams.</span></a> of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, and let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a seer.) </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>They answered them, and said, “He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>As soon as you have come into the city, you will immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will find him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! He will have authority over my people.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then Saul approached Samuel in the gateway, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Samuel answered Saul, and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you are to eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t set your mind on them; for they have been found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father’s house?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, ‘I have invited the people.’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>They arose early; and about daybreak, Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they both went outside, he and Samuel, together.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” He went ahead, then Samuel said, “But stand still first, that I may cause you to hear God’s message.” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 10</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, “Hasn’t Yahweh anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>When you have departed from me today, then you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do for my son?” ’ </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>“Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>They will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>“After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Then Yahweh’s Spirit will come mightily on you, and you will prophesy with them, and will be turned into another man.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>“Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer <span class="w">ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

Wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you are to do.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs happened that day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish?

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>One of the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.” But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn’t tell him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>and he said to the children of Israel, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No!

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come here?” </div>
      <div class="p">Yahweh answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>They ran and got him there.

      <div class="p">All the people shouted, and said, “Long live the king!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be gouged out.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their voice, and wept. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>God’s Spirit came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger burned hot.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>He counted them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>They said to the messengers who came, “Tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be rescued.’ ” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>On the next day, Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Saul said, “No man shall be put to death today; for today Yahweh has rescued Israel.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.”  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Now, behold, the king walks before you.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.” </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>“When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us;’ when Yahweh your God was your king.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for. Behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>But if you will not listen to Yahweh’s voice, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then Yahweh’s hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers. </div>

He sent the rest of the people to their own tents.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered an abomination to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Saul said, “Bring the <span class="w">ascension</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the <span class="w">ascension</span><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

      <div class="p">Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the <span class="w">ascension</span><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>But now your kingdom will not continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, each man to sharpen his own plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>The price was one payim<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">A payim (or pim) was 2/3 shekel of silver, or 0.26 ounces, or 7.6 grams</span></a> each to sharpen mattocks, plowshares, pitchforks, axes, and goads.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 14</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>including Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn’t know that Jonathan was gone.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!” </div>
      <div class="p">Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the raiders, also trembled; and the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s ark here.” For God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>So Yahweh saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over by Beth Aven. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When the people had come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ ” The people were faint. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat with the blood.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me today!”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Every man bring me here his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’ ” All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>Saul built an altar to Yahweh. This was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” </div>
      <div class="p">They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” </div>
      <div class="p">Then the priest said, “Let us draw near here to God.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been today.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40 </span>Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” </div>
      <div class="p">The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V41">41 </span>Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.” </div>
      <div class="p">Jonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people escaped. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V42">42 </span>Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” </div>
      <div class="p">Jonathan was selected. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V43">43 </span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!” </div>
      <div class="p">Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V44">44 </span>Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V45">45 </span>The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today!” So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn’t die.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46 </span>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V47">47 </span>Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48 </span>He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49 </span>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50 </span>The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51 </span>Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52 </span>There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him into his service. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 15</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Saul summoned the people, and counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, of the cattle, and of the fat calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said to him, “Say on.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Why then didn’t you obey Yahweh’s voice, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed Yahweh’s voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in <span class="w">ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.</span></a> Because you have rejected Yahweh’s word, he has also rejected you from being king.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.” </div>

      <div class="p">Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel. </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” </div>
      <div class="p">Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don’t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.” </div>
      <div class="p">Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, “Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then one of the young men answered, and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>A champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.

Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight together!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. The man was an elderly old man in the days of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a> of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down?

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>David said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.” </div>
      <div class="p">Saul said to David, “Go! Yahweh will be with you.”  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not tested them.” Then David took them off. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V40">40 </span>He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41 </span>The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42 </span>When the Philistine looked around, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43 </span>The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44 </span>The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V45">45 </span>Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46 </span>Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines today to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47 </span>and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V48">48 </span>When the Philistine arose, and walked and came near to meet David, David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49 </span>David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50 </span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51 </span>Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52 </span>The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53 </span>The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they plundered their camp.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54 </span>David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55 </span>When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” </div>
      <div class="p">Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V56">56 </span>The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V57">57 </span>As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58 </span>Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?” </div>
      <div class="p">David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the men of war.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Saul said to David, “Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh’s battles.” For Saul said, “Don’t let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, “You shall today be my son-in-law a second time.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ ” Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Then the princes of the Philistines went out; and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 19</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Saul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Michal took the teraphim,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.</span></a> and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?” </div>
      <div class="p">Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Saul was told, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Saul sent messengers to seize David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God’s Spirit came on Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” </div>
      <div class="p">One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God’s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 20</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>He said to him, “Far from it; you will not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me. Why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David swore moreover, and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:’ but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>If he says, ‘It is well;’ your servant shall have peace: but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you; but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Jonathan said, “Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” They both went out into the field.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Jonathan said to David, “By Yahweh, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, won’t I then send to you, and disclose it to you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace. May Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>but you shall also not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the surface of the earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>So Jonathan made a covenant with David’s house, saying, “Yahweh will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>When you have stayed three days, go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and remain by the stone Ezel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;’ then come; for there is peace to you and no danger, as Yahweh lives.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you;’ then go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon had come, the king sat himself down to eat food.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Nevertheless Saul didn’t say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why doesn’t the son of Jesse come to eat, either yesterday, or today?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>Jonathan cried after the boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40 </span>Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V41">41 </span>As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42 </span>Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have both sworn in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘Yahweh is between me and you, and between my offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> and your offspring,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> forever.’ ” He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 21</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.” </div>
      <div class="p">David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, </div>
      <div class="q">‘Saul has slain his thousands, </div>
      <div class="q2">and David his ten thousands?’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 22</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.” </div>
      <div class="p">Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.” </div>
      <div class="p">He answered, “Here I am, my lord.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!” </div>
      <div class="p">Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For you will be safe with me.” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 23</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David was told, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?” </div>
      <div class="p">Yahweh said to David, “Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Saul was told that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Then David said, “O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.” </div>
      <div class="p">Yahweh said, “He will come down.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” </div>
      <div class="p">Yahweh said, “They will deliver you up.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. Saul was told that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn’t deliver him into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>He said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father won’t find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>They both made a covenant before Yahweh. Then David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Now therefore, O king, come down. According to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Saul said, “You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I have been told that he deals very crafty.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you. It shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Sela Hammahlekoth” means “rock of parting”.</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 24</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>When Saul had returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>David’s men said to him, “Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’ ” Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe secretly.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>He said to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” </div>
      <div class="p">When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you?’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Behold, today your eyes have seen how Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand will not be on you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me today.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 25</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and mourned for him, and buried him at his house at Ramah. </div>
      <div class="p">Then David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t harm them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!” </div>
      <div class="p">Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he insulted them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn’t miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t speak to him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">1 seah is about 7 liters or 1.9 gallons or 0.8 pecks</span></a> of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>She said to her young men, “Go on before me. Behold, I am coming after you.” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>As she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.” <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, male.</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off of her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>She fell at his feet, and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Please don’t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">“Nabal” means “foolish”.</span></a> is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn’t see my lord’s young men, whom you sent.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights Yahweh’s battles. Evil will not be found in you all your days.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies, as from the hollow of a sling.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>It will come to pass, when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>For indeed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">or, one male.</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing, until the morning light.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself as wife.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40 </span>When David’s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V41">41 </span>She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”  <span class="verse" id="V42">42 </span>Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43 </span>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44 </span>Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 26</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?” </div>
      <div class="p">Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Yahweh’s anointed, and be guiltless?”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>David said, “As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Yahweh forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a <span class="w">death-sleep</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">a death-like sleep typically rendered as “deep sleep” in English Bibles.</span></a> from Yahweh was fallen on them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?” </div>
      <div class="p">Then Abner answered, “Who are you who cries to the king?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>This thing isn’t good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” </div>
      <div class="p">David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>He said, “Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have driven me out today that I shouldn’t cling to Yahweh’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Now therefore, don’t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Behold, as your life was respected today in my eyes, so let my life be respected in Yahweh’s eyes, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will both do mightily, and will surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 27</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David said in his heart, “I will now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Saul was told that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, on the way to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David struck the land, and saved no man or woman alive, and took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned, and came to Achish. </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.

      <div class="p">His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. Then he said, “Please consult for me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>The woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, “As Yahweh lives, no punishment will happen to you for this thing.” </div>

      <div class="p">He said, “Bring Samuel up for me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!” </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>He said to her, “What does he look like?” </div>
      <div class="p">She said, “An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.” Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?” </div>
      <div class="p">Saul answered, “I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, by prophets, or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of Samuel’s words. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all day long or all night long. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your servant has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night. </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek; and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What about these Hebrews?” </div>
      <div class="p">Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to today?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Isn’t this David, of whom people sang to one another in dances, saying, </div>
      <div class="q">‘Saul has slain his thousands, </div>
      <div class="q2">and David his ten thousands?’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Then Achish called David, and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords don’t favor you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Achish answered David, “I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 30</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>When David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They didn’t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” </div>
      <div class="p">Abiathar brought the ephod to David.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them?” </div>
      <div class="p">He answered him, “Pursue; for you will surely overtake them, and will without fail recover all.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn’t go over the brook Besor.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I got sick.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Then David said, “Do not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays with the baggage. They shall share alike.”  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you from the plunder of Yahweh’s enemies.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>to those who were in Racal, to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>to those who were in Hormah, to those who were in Borashan, to those who were in Athach,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay. </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Joab the son of Zeruiah and David’s servants went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!” </div>
      <div class="p">Joab said, “Let them arise!”  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Helkath Hazzurim” means “field of daggers”.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The battle was very severe that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before David’s servants.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Asahel pursued Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” </div>
      <div class="p">He answered, “It is.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I look Joab your brother in the face?”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. The sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Joab said, “As God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a> lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother.”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, and they fought no more.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen men of David’s and Asahel were missing.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>But David’s servants had struck Benjamin and of Abner’s men so that three hundred sixty men died.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now there was long war between Saul’s house and David’s house. David grew stronger and stronger, but Saul’s house grew weaker and weaker.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>While there was war between Saul’s house and David’s house, Abner made himself strong in Saul’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Then Abner was very angry about Ishbosheth’s words, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to Saul’s house your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman!  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to him;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>to transfer the kingdom from Saul’s house, and to set up David’s throne over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>He could not answer Abner another word, because he was afraid of him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand will be with you, to bring all Israel around to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>He said, “Good. I will make a treaty with you, but one thing I require of you. That is, you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I was given to marry for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Behold, David’s servants and Joab came from a raid, and brought in a great plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Then Joab came to the king, and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is already gone?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>You know Abner the son of Ner. He came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn in front of Abner.” King David followed the bier.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at Abner’s grave; and all the people wept.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>The king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>Your hands weren’t bound, and your feet weren’t put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.” </div>
      <div class="p">All the people wept again over him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>All the people came to urge David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>I am weak today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.” </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>When Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today).  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came about Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>They came there into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king today of Saul, and of his offspring.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>when someone told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he brought good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and rid the earth of you?”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>David commanded his young men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in Abner’s grave in Hebron. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 5</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and in. Yahweh said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here”; thinking, “David can’t come in here.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer. </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there God’s ark, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>They set God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house that was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>They brought it out of Abinadab’s house, which was in the hill, with God’s ark; and Ahio went before the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of cypress wood, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with castanets, and with cymbals.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for God’s ark, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by God’s ark.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Perez Uzzah” means “outbreak against Uzzah”.</span></a> to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, “How could Yahweh’s ark come to me?”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>So David would not move Yahweh’s ark to be with him in David’s city; but David carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Yahweh’s ark remained in Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all his house.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>King David was told, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that belongs to him, because of God’s ark.” </div>

The children of wickedness will not afflict them any more, as at the first,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>When your days are fulfilled, and you sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> after you, who will proceed out of your body, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>I will be his father, and he will be my son.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Lord<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span></a> Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come; and this among men, Lord Yahweh!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Therefore you are great, Yahweh God.

      <div class="p">He said, “I am your servant.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect.

      <div class="p">He answered, “Behold, your servant!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>David said to him, “Don’t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants.

      <div class="p">Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s table.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>When they told David this, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. The Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may Yahweh do what seems good to him.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>David was told that; and he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more. </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 12</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The rich man had very many flocks and herds,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>David’s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’ </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>“This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” </div>
      <div class="p">Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin.

      <div class="p">Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was very sick.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” </div>
      <div class="p">They said, “He is dead.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house; and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">“Jedidiah” means “loved by Yahweh”.</span></a> for Yahweh’s sake. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces</span></a> of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 13</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?” </div>
      <div class="p">Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Then every man went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!” </div>
      <div class="p">But he would not listen to her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>She had a garment of various colors on her; for the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” </div>
      <div class="p">So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” </div>
      <div class="p">The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 14</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Joab sent to Tekoa, and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Go in to the king, and speak like this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The king said to her, “What ails you?” </div>
      <div class="p">She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Your servant had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Behold, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, may the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and may the king and his throne be guiltless.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>The king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you any more.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Then she said, “Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “Say on.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>The woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. Your servant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God, be with you.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.” </div>
      <div class="p">The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” </div>
      <div class="p">The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your servant;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>The king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, and bring the young man Absalom back.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 200 shekels is about 2 kilograms or about 4.4 pounds.</span></a> after the king’s weight.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman with a beautiful face.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and he didn’t see the king’s face.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. Then he sent again a second time, but he would not come.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Therefore he said to his servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.” ’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 15</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>After this, Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?” </div>
      <div class="p">He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Absalom said to him, “Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>The king said to him, “Go in peace.” </div>
      <div class="p">So he arose, and went to Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Whereas you came but yesterday, should I today make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Ittai answered the king, and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king is, whether for death or for life, your servant will be there also.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God’s ark; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The king said to Zadok, “Carry God’s ark back into the city. If I find favor in Yahweh’s eyes, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>but if he says, ‘I have no delight in you;’ behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.”  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God’s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” </div>
      <div class="p">David said, “Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore whatever you hear out of the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Send to me everything that you shall hear by them.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem. </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The king said to Ziba, “What do you mean by these?” </div>
      <div class="p">Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.” </div>

He came out and cursed as he came.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 17</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” </div>
      <div class="p">The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.” </div>
      <div class="p">When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 18</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.” </div>
      <div class="p">The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>They took Absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run, and carry the king news, how Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” </div>
      <div class="p">Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>“But come what may,” he said, “I will run.” </div>
      <div class="p">He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper, and said, “Behold, a man running alone!” </div>
      <div class="p">The king said, “He also brings news.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” </div>
      <div class="p">The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” </div>
      <div class="p">Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>The king said, “Turn aside, and stand here.” He turned aside, and stood still. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” </div>
      <div class="p">The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!” </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 19</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Joab was told, “Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The victory that day was turned into mourning among all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared today, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died today, then it would have pleased you well.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don’t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>You are my brothers. You are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually instead of Joab.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>A ferry boat went to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>He said to the king, “Don’t let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh’s anointed?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For don’t I know that I am king over Israel today?”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>The king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” The king swore to him. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>He has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.”  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old. He had provided the king with sustenance while he stayed at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>Barzillai said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>I am eighty years old, today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and singing women any more? Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you request of me, that I will do for you.” </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did.

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Joab’s men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>One of Joab’s young men stood by him, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway.

They were gathered together, and went also after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear!

      <div class="p">He answered, “I am.” </div>
      <div class="p">Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your servant.” </div>
      <div class="p">He answered, “I’m listening.” </div>

You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up Yahweh’s inheritance?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>The matter is not so.

      <div class="p">The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>and Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David. </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take plunder.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>But he stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>David longed, and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>He said, “Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t this the blood of the men who risked their lives to go?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>Wasn’t he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain. However he wasn’t included as one of the three.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in a time of snow.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>He killed a huge Egyptian, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty: Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29 </span>Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30 </span>Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31 </span>Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32 </span>Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33 </span>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34 </span>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35 </span>Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36 </span>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37 </span>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38 </span>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39 </span>and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all. </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Again Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, “Go, count Israel and Judah.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, “Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the sum of the people.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Joab said to the king, “Now may Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Joab gave up the sum of the counting of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>David’s heart struck him after he had counted the people. David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>When David rose up in the morning, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>“Go and speak to David, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.” ’ ” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let us fall now into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into man’s hand.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and seventy thousand men died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” </div>
      <div class="p">David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the <span class="w">ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah). Typically rendered “burnt offering(s)” in English Bibles. </span></a>, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.” </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>The king said to Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer <span class="w">ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah). Typically rendered “burnt offering(s)” in English Bibles. </span></a> to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 50 shekels is about 0.5 kilograms or 1.1 pounds.</span></a> of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered <span class="w">ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah). Typically rendered “burnt offering(s)” in English Bibles. </span></a> and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel. </div>
