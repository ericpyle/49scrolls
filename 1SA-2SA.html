 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">&#8220;Yahweh&#8221; is God&#8217;s proper Name, sometimes rendered &#8220;LORD&#8221; (all caps) in other translations.</span></a> of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As he did so year by year, when she went up to Yahweh&#8217;s house. Her rival provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn&#8217;t eat.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep? Why don&#8217;t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh&#8217;s temple.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She vowed a vow, and said, &#8220;Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Eli said to her, &#8220;How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hannah answered, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Don&#8217;t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Eli answered, &#8220;Go in peace; and may the God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#8224;<span class="popup">The Hebrew word rendered &#8220;God&#8221; is &#8220;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;&#8221; (Elohim).</span></a> of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>She said, &#8220;Let your servant find favor in your sight.&#8221; So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn&#8217;t sad any more. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. Yahweh&#8217;s word was precious in those days.
