      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 1</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 2</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>But say the things which fit sound doctrine,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. </div>
