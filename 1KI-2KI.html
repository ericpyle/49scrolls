The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all of cast metal.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>There were four supports at the four corners of each base. Its supports were of the base itself.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>In the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its supports and its panels were of the same.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>On the plates of its supports, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, each in its space, with wreaths all around.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He made the ten bases in this way: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He made ten basins of brass. One basin contained forty baths;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#8224;<span class="popup">1 bath is one tenth of a cor, or about 5.6 U.

He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward and toward the south.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Hiram made the basins, the shovels, and the basins.

The weight of the brass could not be determined.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Solomon made all the vessels that were in Yahweh&#8217;s house: the golden altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold;  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>and the lamp stands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Thus all the work that king Solomon did in Yahweh&#8217;s house was finished.
