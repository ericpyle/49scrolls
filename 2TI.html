 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For God didn&#8217;t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore don&#8217;t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For this cause I also suffer these things. </div><div class="p">Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord&#8217;s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 2</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn&#8217;t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> of David, according to my Good News,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God&#8217;s word isn&#8217;t chained.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones&#8217; sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This saying is trustworthy: </div><div class="q">&#8220;For if we died with him, </div><div class="q2">we will also live with him. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If we endure, </div><div class="q2">we will also reign with him. </div><div class="q">If we deny him, </div><div class="q2">he also will deny us. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If we are faithless, </div><div class="q2">he remains faithful. </div><div class="q2">For he can&#8217;t deny himself.&#8221; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don&#8217;t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn&#8217;t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>However God&#8217;s firm foundation stands, having this seal, &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Numbers 16:5</span></a> and, &#8220;Let every one who names the name of the Lord<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#8224;<span class="popup">TR reads &#8220;Christ&#8221; instead of &#8220;the Lord&#8221;</span></a> depart from unrighteousness.&#8221;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master&#8217;s use, prepared for every good work. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord&#8217;s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil&#8217;s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, Every writing inspired by God is</span></a> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 4</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Be diligent to come to me soon,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </div></div><ul class="tnav"><li><a href="index.html">index</a></li></ul></body></html>
