He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>“Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>This again you do: you cover Yahweh’s altar with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought godly offspring.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For I hate divorce”, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “and him who covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don’t deal treacherously.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in Yahweh’s sight, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’ </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div><div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>“Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>“But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>“For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there will not be room enough for.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>“All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,” says Yahweh of Armies. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>“Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against you?’  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him. </div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 4</div><div class="p">&#13;
