 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who, when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>For to which of the angels did he say at any time, </div>
      <div class="q">“You are my Son. </div>

      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Deuteronomy 32:43 LXX</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Of the angels he says, </div>

      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; </div>

      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>They will perish, but you continue. </div>

      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>But one has somewhere testified, saying, </div>
      <div class="q">“What is man, that you think of him? </div>
      <div class="q2">Or the son of man, that you care for him? </div>
      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>You made him a little lower than the angels. </div>
      <div class="q2">You crowned him with glory and honor.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">TR adds “and set him over the works of your hands”</span></a> </div>
      <div class="q2"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 8:4-6 </span></a> </div>
      <div class="p">For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>saying, </div>
      <div class="q">“I will declare your name to my brothers. </div>
      <div class="q2">Among of the congregation I will sing your praise.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 22:22</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>Again, “I will put my trust in him.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 8:17</span></a> Again, “Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 8:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, </div>
      <div class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice, </div>
      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, </div>
      <div class="q2">like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, </div>
      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>where your fathers tested me by proving me, </div>
      <div class="q2">and saw my deeds for forty years. </div>
      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation, </div>
      <div class="q2">and said, ‘They always err in their heart, </div>
      <div class="q2">but they didn’t know my ways;’ </div>
      <div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>as I swore in my wrath, </div>
      <div class="q2">‘They will not enter into my rest.’ ”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 95:7-11</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>while it is said, </div>
      <div class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice, </div>
      <div class="q2">don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 95:7-8</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn’t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 4</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest”;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 95:11 </span></a> although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works”;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Genesis 2:2</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 95:11</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of disobedience,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), </div>
      <div class="q">“Today if you will hear his voice, </div>
      <div class="q2">don’t harden your hearts.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 95:7-8</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 5</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, </div>
      <div class="q">“You are my Son. </div>
      <div class="q2">Today I have become your father.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 2:7</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>As he says also in another place, </div>
      <div class="q">“You are a priest forever, </div>
      <div class="q2">after the order of Melchizedek.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 110:4</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 6</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>This will we do, if God permits.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Genesis 22:17</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. </div>
      <div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 7</div>
      <div class="p">&#13;
 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, “king of righteousness”, and then also “king of Salem”, which means “king of peace”;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best plunder.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>for it is testified, </div>
      <div class="q">“You are a priest forever, </div>
      <div class="q2">according to the order of Melchizedek.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 110:4</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath  <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, </div>
      <div class="q">“The Lord swore and will not change his mind, </div>
      <div class="q2">‘You are a priest forever, </div>

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1 </span>Now indeed even the first<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">TR adds “tabernacle”</span></a> covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2 </span>For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3 </span>After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4 </span>having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5 </span>and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6 </span>Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7 </span>but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8 </span>The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9 </span>which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshiper perfect;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10 </span>being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation. </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11 </span>But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12 </span>nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13 </span>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14 </span>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15 </span>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16 </span>For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17 </span>For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18 </span>Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19 </span>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20 </span>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Exodus 24:8</span></a> </div>
      <div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21 </span>Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22 </span>According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23 </span>It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24 </span>For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25 </span>nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26 </span>or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27 </span>Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28 </span>so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation. </div>
