 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation&#8212;which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For he didn&#8217;t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But one has somewhere testified, saying, </div><div class="q">&#8220;What is man, that you think of him? </div><div class="q2">Or the son of man, that you care for him? </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You made him a little lower than the angels. </div><div class="q2">You crowned him with glory and honor.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">TR adds &#8220;and set him over the works of your hands&#8221;</span></a> </div><div class="q2"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You have put all things in subjection under his feet.&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 8:4-6 </span></a> </div><div class="p">For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him.

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, </div><div class="q">&#8220;Today if you will hear his voice, </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>don&#8217;t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, </div><div class="q2">like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>where your fathers tested me by proving me, </div><div class="q2">and saw my deeds for forty years. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation, </div><div class="q2">and said, &#8216;They always err in their heart, </div><div class="q2">but they didn&#8217;t know my ways;&#8217; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>as I swore in my wrath, </div><div class="q2">&#8216;They will not enter into my rest.&#8217;&#8221;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 95:7-11</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called &#8220;today&#8221;; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>while it is said, </div><div class="q">&#8220;Today if you will hear his voice, </div><div class="q2">don&#8217;t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 95:7-8</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For who, when they heard, rebelled?

 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So also Christ didn&#8217;t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, </div><div class="q">&#8220;You are my Son. </div><div class="q2">Today I have become your father.&#8221;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 2:7</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>As he says also in another place, </div><div class="q">&#8220;You are a priest forever, </div><div class="q2">after the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#10017;<span class="popup">Psalm 110:4</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God.
